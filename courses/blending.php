                    Hopefully you have been reading 'Cat in the Hat' or similar.  It is now time to move on to harder grade-2 chapter books.

                    I recommend the 'Junie B. Jones' books for both boys and girls, and for \
                    all ages including adults.  They are well-written, funny, and subversive.  Older boys \
                    will also enjoy the 'Secret Agent Jack Stalwart' series.

                    Older students and adults are usually impatient to start harder, 'useful' books, \
                    but that is always a mistake.  They will only get frustrated and make no further progress.",
